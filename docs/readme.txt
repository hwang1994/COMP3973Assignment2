-I think I completed all requirements
-Major challenge was dockerizing the API/Blazor parts
-Must recreate the dist folder for the API project!!!! Other than that, no special instructions I can think of (docker-compose up works for me). 
I deleted the bin and obj folders (like in the first assignment) for the API and Blazor projects to make the zip file reasonably small. I also deleted the dist folder in the API project.
I did NOT delete the output folder in the Blazor project since it is critical for getting docker-compose up working with Dockferfile/nginx.
